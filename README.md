# Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Terraform for multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning, supporting AWS, GCP, and other cloud providers. It enables a company to transition from i.e. AWS dependency to a multi-cloud strategy, aligning with the company's merger. The goal is to showcase Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Terraform Cloud's value over other tools like Ansible and custom scripts.

## Features

- Multi-cloud provisioning with Terraform.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent deployment.
- Integration with Terraform Cloud for automation and collaboration.

## What will this do?

The idea is to demonstrate how you can provision a simple compute instance in both AWS and GCP.

## What are the prerequisites?

- Terraform Cloud account.
- Terraform CLI installed.
- Cloud provider credentials for AWS/GCP/Azure.
- The values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`, and `GOOGLE_PROJECT` should be saved as environment variables on your workspace.
